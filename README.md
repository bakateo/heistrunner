## Description
"Heistrunner" is a first-person jump 'n' run game in which players must parkour their way through obstacles and sneak into a heavily guarded building called the Megasafe to steal the city's greatest treasure. The obstacles can be mastered with abillities like sliding, wall running, edge climbing and covering geat distances with a grappling gun.
